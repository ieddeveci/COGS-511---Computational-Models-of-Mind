# COGS-511---Computational-Models-of-Mind
This repository contains the homework assignments, project work, and supplementary materials for COGS 511 – Computational Models of Mind, Fall 2025. It focuses on the study and implementation of cognitive architectures, including ACT-R and Nengo, providing practical examples and exercises in modeling human cognition computationally. The repository includes code, simulation files, and documentation to support hands-on learning and exploration of cognitive modeling concepts.

Homework 1 implements ACT-R models of two-digit addition and subtraction, using structured chunks, goal-driven procedures, and finger counting to simulate carries and borrows while leveraging declarative memory and procedural rules to manage the task flow.

Homework 2 implements an ACT-R model of letter recognition and comparison, using goal-driven visual attention and imaginal encoding to sequentially attend to three letters, store them in memory, and determine which letter differs from the others.
